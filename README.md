# ARAKS is our participation in JunctionxKaust2019 Hackathon

Junction is a global tech community with the mission to empower people to create with technology. This is done through organising hackathons and other events for those interested. In 2015, Junction was organised in Finland for the first time but has since expanded all over the globe with its JunctionX concept.

JunctionX KAUST was organised for the second time in 2019 with over double the number of participants. The hackers had the opportunity to envision, develop and showcase their solutions for life in the cities of the future on the topics of energy, water and food.
